Here's what you can find on my Github:
I’m currently adding CTF writeups and security challenges. I’ve been working on consolidating my notes into one place, as they’ve previously been scattered across multiple locations.

What I do now:

- **IT & Security Support**

Troubleshooting hardware, software, and network issues. Providing support for cloud services like Azure and Office 365. Ensuring user assistance while protecting systems.

- **InfoSec/Incident Response Team**

Working with EDR solutions and being part of an email security project. Familiar with tools like AppRiver, Mimecast, and Defender in Office 365.

- **Hands-On Learning**

Experimenting with VMs, restoring old tech, modding devices, and creating real-world scenarios in my home lab.

- **CTFs (Capture The Flags)**

Regularly active on platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and CyberDefender. Participating in smaller CTFs like Huntress and Cyber Drain.
