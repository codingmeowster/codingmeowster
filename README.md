Here's what you can find on my Github:
I’m currently adding CTF writeups and security challenges. I’ve been working on consolidating my notes into one place, as they’ve previously been scattered across multiple locations.

What I do now:

- **IT Support**

Troubleshooting hardware, software, and network issues. Providing support for Azure and Office 365. Configuring and deploying network devices, maintaining IT documentation, and enforcing security policies.

- **InfoSec/Incident Response**

Familiar with Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions and contributing to an email security project. Experienced in using email security and filtering tools to analyze phishing threats and implement strategies to mitigate email-based attacks. Proficient in Antivirus and application control solutions to protect endpoints from security threats.

- **Hands-On Learning & Tinkering**

Experimenting with virtual machines, restoring vintage tech, modding devices, building custom keyboards, tinkering with my 3D printer, and creating real-world scenarios in my home lab—this.

- **CTFs (Capture The Flags)**

Regularly active on platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and CyberDefender. Participating in sesonal CTFs like Huntress and Cyber Drain.
